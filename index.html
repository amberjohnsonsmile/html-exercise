    <h1>Cities I've lived</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a Colorado native, born and raised! I grew up in Fort Collins, moved to Greeley to go to college, then moved back.

    <ul>
      <li>
        Fort Collins, CO
      </li>
      <li>
        Greeley, CO

    </ul>
    <h1>Cities I'd like to visit</h1>
    <p>
      I love Japanese food and animation, so it would be very exciting to visit Tokyo. Hanoi was suggested to me by a friend I made on a backpacking trip. He said he meant to visit the city for a few days, and ended up staying almost a year. It sounds like Chicago has great art, so I'd love to check out the museums there.
